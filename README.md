# Micro TCP - server and client implementation with secure SSL/TLS support
Micro TCP is a simple TCP server- and client implementation with SSL/TLS support, built fully on top of Boost.Asio.

## Features
* Server (session) implementation where a session is defined as:
    1. secure handshake
    2. wait for incoming message/request
    3. read message contents
    4. handle request / create response
    5. send response
    6. go back to ii., wait for a new message.
* Client (session) implementation where a session is defined as:
    1. secure handshake
    2. send request
    3. wait for incoming message/response
    4. handle response
    5. keep session alive until manually closed or timeout (timeout in development).
* Secure communication over SSL/TLS (enabled by default with a strong cipher suite)
* Multithread support (enabled by default)
* Asynchronous implementation
* Basic file transfer and/or receive support
* Implement your custom response and request handler, override the examples (see next heading)
* Built fully on top of Boost.Asio
* Custom messaging protocol
* MIT License
* **Note:** this project is still under development and is provided as is, without any warranty (see License).

## Develop yourself (important, read this)
Core functionality has been implemented, yet personal features such as request and response handling, 
should be implemented by the user! Below I will attempt to guide you through some of files that should/could
be developed.

**Override and implement** the following classes to suit your own needs:
* **request_handler:** inherit this class and override the handle_request functionality.
    * _**Example implementation:**_ echo's back the received message.
    * **_See:_** _include/micro_tcp/request_handler.hpp_
* **response_handler:** inherit this class and override the handle_response functionality.
    * _**Example implementation:**_ if the response is larger than 10000 bytes it assumes we received a file, which will be 
    written to _test.out_. Otherwise it will be written to stdout.
    * **_See:_** _include/micro_tcp/response_handler.hpp_
    
## Supported platforms
* Linux / OSX
* Windows _(only tested with MinGW-W64)_

## Dependencies
* **C++14:** a C++14 compatible compiler is required for e.g. lambda auto and smart_ptr functionality.
* **Boost:** in particular, Boost.Asio is required.
* **OpenSSL:** Boost.Asio uses OpenSSL for basic SSL/TLS support and of course secure sockets.
* **CMake:** version 3.5. or later is required to be able to use the provided CMakeLists.txt.

## Build steps
To build the example, simply run CMake and build.

````
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
````

You can find the binary in the build/bin directory. 
Don't forget to add the program option --config path_to_config.xml when running.

## Usage provided example
The provided example (_src/main.cpp_), provides a basic console application. Before you start, edit the provided 
config file accordingly ()_example/config.xml_ ). Also, the provided secure files 
(_example/secure/*_), e.g. the certificate chain and key, are just examples. Generate your own if
you decide to go live with this:

````
Example for a self-signed certificate:
$ openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -days 3000 -nodes -x509 -keyout private.key.pem -out certificate.cert.pem
We just act as the self-signed root CA, so just copy the certificate to a new certificate-chain file:
$ cp certificate.cert.pem certificate-chain.cert.pem
Encrypt your private key with a password (optional):
$ ssh-keygen -p -f private.key.pem
Generate a Diffie-Hellman parameters file (at least 2048 bit):
$ openssl dhparam -out dhparam.pem 4096
````

**Run** the application with the program option --config path_to_config.xml (you can fully remove the config in the _src/main.cpp_ if you like).

Below is a list of supported commands (through stdin).
* server_start | starts the server on the listening address and port as defined in the _example/config.xml_ (override in _src/main.cpp_).
* client_connect | attempts to start a client session with the server as defined in the _example/config.xml_ (override in _src/main.cpp_).
* client_send | prompts for a message and sends it to the selected server (by default the local server).
* client_send_file | prompts for a file path and sends it to the selected server (by default the local server).
* client_disconnect | closes the session for this client.
* server_stop | stops the server.
* server_set_address | prompts for a new server listening address.
* server_set_port | prompts for a new server listening port.
* status | gives some basic client/server information.
* quit | stops the application (return 0).

Found a bug or have feedback? Please create an issue on GitHub. All feedback is welcome! Do 
note that this project is still under development and bugs may occur. I will try to respond/solve
bugs as fast as possible but please do not expect a fully operational help desk.
